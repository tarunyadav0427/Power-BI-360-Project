# Power-BI-360-Project
AtliQ Hardwares is a consumer electronics company expanding rapidly but is not able to compete with other companies using data as most of their report still exists in Excel. My goal is to implement an advanced analytics solution using Power BI that will enable the company to get insights and make informed decisions

In this project, the objective was to create a comprehensive report tailored for stakeholders in sales, marketing, finance, and the executive team. Emphasis was placed on:

1. **Robust Data Modeling:** Establishing a strong foundation for analysis through meticulous data modeling.

2. **User-Empathetic Report Design:** Crafting reports with a user-centric approach, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation.

3. **Drillable Insights:** Providing stakeholders with the ability to explore data intricacies for personalized insights.

Throughout the project, I acquired proficiency in:

- Power Query for both basic and advanced operations.
- Development of basic and complex DAX formulas.
- Execution of data modeling involving over 10 tables.
- Selection of appropriate visuals and meticulous formatting for enhanced comprehension.
- Adherence to dashboard designing principles for an optimal user experience.
- Strategic utilization of bookmarks to streamline navigation and interaction.
- Deployment of the project in Power BI service for accessibility and collaboration.
- Iterative implementation of stakeholder feedback to align the report with evolving requirements.
- Integration of metrics spanning sales, marketing, finance, and supply chain domains.

This experience not only refined my technical skills but underscored the importance of aligning data insights with the diverse needs of stakeholders across various business functions.
